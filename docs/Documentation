**So this is all I did -**

The database was created with 5 normalized tables and populated using dummy_data.py.
Flask API was built to return products, salts, reviews, and descriptions.
JWT-based login system implemented with a dummy username and password.
React frontend is fully dynamic – no hardcoded content.
UI is broken into reusable components like SaltSection, CompareSection, etc.
All data is fetched from the backend using async API calls.
Design is responsive and clean, following the reference layout.
As an extra, I added a logout button for better UX.
Product images were taken from Medingen’s actual live site.

(optional readings below, Just my experience with this task)

**My confusions -**

I was a bit uncertain about the image uploaded in documentation, I thought i have to make something similar to it. To Stay clear I sticked to the textual instructions.

**My challenges -** 

1. I was stuck in mysql db because i added an auto increamenter and due to which it must keep on adding the other product items keeping last p_id intact. It's a feature not a bug. So I dropped the table and started fresh. 
2. When i was using the Medigen logo and image assets from their site i found that there is no right click which is disabled i guess for safety so I did ctrl+shift+I. Pretty basic for me.
3. JWT authroization was basic but i was stuck when I was testing salts. It was just the bearer token expired, i refreshed my knowledge it has a lifespan of a token is 15 min only. Like it's minimum age of a Mayfly. Anyways...
4. Just when i started working i saw watchers on my github repo, Someone is watching my work. I hate to share unfinished work so i change visibility to private. I will surely make it public

**My Note -** 

Thank you so much for refreshing my knowledge about mysql, i usually use MERN stack. 
But for my own surprise i picked up MYSQL very quick. I am still learning AWS I am not that confident in that because of just learning i exhausted my 750 hr of ec2 machine as i was fond of building python script about whatsapp scheduler and like a softwere to do all google reviews. though i succeed but i exhauseted all of the free tier. Now i am learning rds in aws because i have to create a saas for an online store Print24*7, they told me to develop some kind of software that organize their internal task like po, so...

Thanks for everything once again !
It's just that i wanted to talk and no one's here, so i did through this. 
Thank for listening..(sorry)..Reading..
